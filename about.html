          <h5>Dance, Studio Break a Leg, Skopje, Macedonia</h5>
          <i>September 2012 - Present</i>
          <blockquote>
            I have been a part of 2 different dance studios in the past 11 years
            since I have always loved dancing and expressing my feelings through
            movement. I am regularly participating in many international
            competitions and I have many awards. I do mainly hip hop, but also
            contemporary, jazz, electric boogie, breakdance, etc. When I was
            part of the junior crew, I was the leader of the group. Starting
            from January 2019, I begun teaching hip hop to kids aged 4 to 6 and
            7 to 12. I often substitute for the junior and senior groups
            too. I prepare them for competitions and performances. I additionally have a
            C license for teaching modern dances by the Macedonian Association
            of Modern Dances.
